# File: pliSubstituteParts.lst

# This space-delimited list captures substitute part ID and its substitute part absolute path. 
# This file is an alternative to the embedded file substitution used when defining a PLI/BOM.
# Parts on this list should have an accompanying substitute part.
# Substitue parts must be defined using their absolute file path.
# When building the PLI/BOM files on this list are replaced with their substitute.

# The file path must be quoted even if there are no spaces in the path

# This file can be edited from LPub3D from:
#    Configuration=>Edit Parameter Files=>Edit PLI/BOM Substitue Parts List

# LPub3D will attempt to load the regular expression below first, if the
# load fails, LPub3D will load the hard-coded (default) regular expression.
# If you wish to modify the file import, you can edit this regular expression.
# It would be wise to backup the default entry before performing and update - copy
# and paste to a new line with starting phrase other than 'The Regular Expression..."

# The Regular Expression used is: ^(\b.+\b)\s+"(.*)"\s+(.*)$
