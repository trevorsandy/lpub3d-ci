/***************************************************************************
 *
 * This is the design for the undo/redo mechanism, as well as the activity
 * trace that lets users send debuggers the activity trace, and everything
 * that the user did can be recreated
 *
 * Gui has a QUndoStack named undoStack.  All the undo/redo things are
 * kept on the undo/redo stack.
 *
 * All the user changes that cause the LDraw file(s) to get updated are
 * stored on the undo/redo stack.
 *
 * All of these changes are implemented in metaitem.cpp. They issue all the
 * commands using readLine, insertLine, replaceLine and deleteLine.  These
 * activities all have direct maps to Undo/Redo command types and are easier
 * to track.
 *
 * The special case has to do with users manually editing the LDraw file
 * in the editWindow's textEdit.  Changes to the document can show up as
 * document->contentsChange(int position, int charsRemoved, int charsAdded);
 *
 * By itself, this information is not enough to be able to undo and redo.
 * The contentsChange event is handled locally by the editWindow, and
 * converted to 
 *
 * signal void contentsChange(int position, 
 *                            int charsRemoved, 
 *                            QString charsAdded);
 *
 * This contentsChange signal is connected to Gui.  To be able to undo/redo
 * gui needs to change int charsRemoved to QString charsRemoved, at which
 * time it can be put on the undo/redo stack.
 *
 * contentsChange also need to be reflected to the ldraw files, so that the
 * LDraw file matches the textEdit->document context.
 *
 * Changes made by metaitem.cpp that change the file being displayed by
 * textEdit, need to be reflected in the textEdit document.  Anytime a
 * change is made to the ldraw file, and that LDraw file is being displayed
 * by the editWindow, the gui signals editWindow using this:
 *
 * void displayFile(LDrawFile *ldrawFile, QString subFile);
 *
 * The editWindow disconnects contentsChange events, updates the document's
 * plain text, and then reconnects contentsChange.
