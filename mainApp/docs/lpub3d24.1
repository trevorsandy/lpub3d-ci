NAME
     lpub3d \- An LDraw Building Instructions Editor

SYNOPSIS
     lpub3d

DESCRIPTION
     LPub3D is an Open Source WYSIWYG editing application for creating LEGO® style digital building instructions.
     LPub3D is developed and maintained by Trevor SANDY. It uses the LDraw parts library, the most comprehensive
     library of digital Open Source LEGO® bricks available (www.ldraw.org/ ) and reads the LDraw LDR and MPD model file formats.
     LPub3D is available for free under the GNU Public License v3 and works on the Windows Operating Systems.

     Portions of LPub3D are based on LPUB© 2007-2009 Kevin Clague, LeoCAD© 2019 Leonardo Zide, and additional third party components.

     LEGO®is a trademark of the LEGO Group of companies which does not sponsor, authorize or endorse this application

OPTIONS
     LPub3D does not currently have any runtime options.
     However when building LPub3D from source, two options are available:
        1. CONFIG+=quazipnobuild - Use this option to suppress LPub3D source automatically building the quazip shared library.
        This option is useful when the quazip shared library is already present in the build environment. Please note that you must
        ensure the existing library header files are in the location expected by LPub3D (see mainApp.pro).
        2. CONFIG+=binarybuild - This option is used when building a packaged distribution of LPub3D using QtInstallerFramework
        (see builds directory in LPub3D source for details)

FILES
     Note: library paths below illustrate Debinan/Ubuntu distros. For RH/Fedora, paths are '/usr/lib64/...' and '/usr/lib/...' for Arch.

     /etc/lpub3d.conf
          The system wide configuration file. 
		  
     ~/.config/LPub3D Software/LPub3D.conf
          Per  user  configuration  file. LPub3D settings and directory paths

     ~/.local/share/LPub3D Software/LPub3D/extras/titleannotations.lst
          Parameter files for LDraw parts manipulation within LPub3D

     ~/.local/share/LPub3D Software/LPub3D/libraries/complete.zip
          LEGO® LDraw official parts archive. LPub3D loads this library into memory.
          It does not load library content from the ldraw disc directory

    ~/.local/share/LPub3D Software/LPub3D/libraries/lpub3dldrawunf.zip
          All unofficial LEGO®® LDraw parts including those from the LDraw unofficial library.
          This archive also contains unofficial parts found in subdirectories under LDraw
          unofficial disc directory. At LPub3D startup, all defined unofficial part directories
          are identified and their parts are added to this archive before loading into memory.
          Note that the 'parts' and 'p' LDraw unofficial disc directories are excluded from the
          list of directories searched. So if you place your unofficial parts under the unofficial
          disc directory, place them in a different subdirectory (e.g. /unofficial/mycustomparts/).

    ~/.local/share/LPub3D Software/LPub3D/libraries/tenteparts.zip
          TENTE® construction LDraw parts.

    ~/.local/share/LPub3D Software/LPub3D/libraries/vexiqparts.zip
          VEXIQ® Robotics LDraw parts.

    ~/.local/share/LPub3D Software/LPub3D/logs/LPub3DLog.txt
          Logging files. There can be up to 4 files. Files are cycled when the size reaches 4MB.

         This library is used by LPub3D to detect additional LDraw part directories whereby a user
         can have more than one LDraw disc directories

         Quazip library used to archive unofficial parts (update the lpub3dldrawunf.zip) and to
         expand downloaded libraries into the default LDraw disc directory whereby allowing the uset
